# Project 2 Grading Guidelines

You can find details about the grading process [here](../p1/grading-guidelines.md). 

**Q6 - Q10:**
* Hardcoding (e.g., directly displaying final solution): -5 points for each question

**Q6:**
* Too few data samples (< 3): -3 points

**Q6 - Q8:**
* Missing x-label or y-label: -1 point (only deduct once for all three plots)
* Wrong figure shape: -2 points for each question
    * Q6 should follow a linear trend
    * Q7 loop should spend way more time than BST
    * Q6 and Q7 can have fluctuating milliseconds (or one or two outliers) because the time function depends on the environment of the VM
    * Q8 should have the exact same shape/value because the count is computed from the same dataset

**Q9 - Q10:**
* Didn't write a recursive function/method: -2 points for each question
